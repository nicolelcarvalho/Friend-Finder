  "description": "'Chicago is a city with an appetite—for food, of course, but also for design, history, and culture. Come here to marvel at the cutting-edge architecture or take in the gorgeous views of Lake Michigan; to spend a day cheering with baseball fans and a night laughing at a comedy show; to shop, to visit renowned institutions like the Field Museum and the Adler Planetarium, and to experience the legendary blues scene. To do all this, you'll need nourishment: taste deep-dish pizza, piled-high hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, and more.' - Fodors",

  "description": "'Austin is a boomtown of culture and creativity. It's a hub for music, comedy, and filmmaking, as well as a favorite foodie destination. For the past four years, Austin has been the fastest growing city in the U.S. and the tech boom continues to turn the city into Texas's answer to Silicon Valley. But despite all of its recent the changes, Austin is still an extraordinarily open and welcoming place—a city where you're not only allowed but expected to be yourself, in all your quirky glory.' - Fodors",
